                <h3>E30 M3 (1986–1991)</h3>
                <p>The original E30 M3 was built for Group A homologation — meaning BMW had to produce 5,000 road-going versions to qualify the car for racing. Its wide box fenders, large rear wing, and improved aerodynamics weren’t just for show — they were designed for high-speed track use.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>M3 Evolution I, II & III</li>
